# Project Overview

This educational project demonstrates:
- How common hashing algorithms work (MD5, SHA256, SHA512).
- How secure hashing like `bcrypt` differs from simple hashes.
- How salting prevents rainbow-table style attacks.
- Simple cracking techniques: dictionary attack and very small brute-force generator.

Goals:
- Provide simple, readable code for students.
- Show differences in verifying hashes using different algorithms.
- Offer unit tests and demo scripts for quick experimentation.
